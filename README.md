### About

Starts a specified tone, AM frequency, or FM frequency for experimentation. Can be used in small devices such as [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) hooked up to an amp and [vortex coil](https://1stopenergies.com/).

The Azores Pyramid was the pyramid of Atlantis which was "built for biorhythmic synchronization at precisely calibrated wavelengths that correspond to harmonics of planetary infrasound resonance."[[1]]

It is believed the Great Pyramid of Giza was powered by a ram pump from the Nile River. As the mineral composition of the granite contains a high crystalline content, the intense vibrations from the pump caused the Ã¦ther to ring like a bell at a specific frequency.[[2]]
